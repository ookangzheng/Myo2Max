# Builds of samyk/myo-osc

I just rebuilt the executable including the EMG-Data, removed some redundant loops for my purposes and removed the vibration feedback optionally.
Also includes a Version that has the gesture recognition permanently unlocked using:

    hub.setLockingPolicy(myo::Hub::lockingPolicyNone);

Gestures are recognized this way without having to do the double-tap every time.
