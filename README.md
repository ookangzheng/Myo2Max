# Myo to Max/MSP via OSC

This package enables an out-of-the-box solution to connect the Thalmic Myo to Max/MSP vis OSC and get all the raw data from it.

## myo-osc builds
There are several version of precompiled myo-osc versions for OSX here:
- "novib" disables vibrational feedback of the armband on the poses.
- "unlock" unlocks the gesture recognition without the need for the "double tap".
- The most recent version is the fastest and contains both "features" listed above.

## Myo2Max Package Content
